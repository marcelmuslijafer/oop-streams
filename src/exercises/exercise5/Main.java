/**
 * Exercise: GroupingBy and Averaging
 * Description: Given a list of objects representing students with their names and ages,
 *              group the students by their ages and calculate the average age for each group.
 * Example:
 * Input: [{name: "Alice", age: 20}, {name: "Bob", age: 22}, {name: "Charlie", age: 20}, {name: "Dave", age: 22}]
 * Output: {20: 20.0, 22: 22.0} (since there are two students with age 20 and their average age is 20.0,
 *         and two students with age 22 with an average age of 22.0)
